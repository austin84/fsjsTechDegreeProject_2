This is an example of pagination. This page contains 54
unique Students. Each one is a list item inside one large
unordered list. All of the students are hard coded into
the html. With JavaScript, the list is paginated. Ten
stuents display at a time and a navigation div is created
at the bottom to move through the whole list. There is
also a search feature created with JavaScript. It filters
through the students in real time as you type your query.
